# Laravel Fleet Tracker
This project is a fleet tracking system, it pairs an ESP2866 Micro-Controller with an UBlox NEO-6M GPS Module to form a GPS Receiver and posts its current position in latitude and longitude to a web application every 2 minutes, which then displays the position on a map in real time.

The project makes use of a Laravel MVC application with a Vue front end, the location is updated in real time every two minutes using an event driven Pusher channel. This receives the location object from the back end using an event. This location is then sent to the view via pusher channel which then sends the new coordinates to the map using an asynchronous listener function on the view.

As the location sent from the receiver uses high-precision coordinates, location is accurate to a matter of meters and as the GPS Receiver needs to be powered via battery, it makes use of ESP Deep Sleep commands between post requests, this keeps power consumption at a minimum with an idle consumption of 50mA and an consumption during post requests of 140mA. Minimal power saving measures have been applied and these figures can be reduced further using a greater level of optimisation.

The map used is an open source Mapbox/Leaflet JS stack.

## Key Files

__gps_receiver.ino - /sketch/gps_receiver__

Parses in raw NMEA strings and sends them in a post request to the location endpoint

                void loop() {
                  while (gps.available( gpsPort ))
                    doSomeWork( gps.read() );
                }

                static void doSomeWork( const gps_fix & fix )
                {
                  if (fix.valid.location) {
                    postData = "lat=" + String(fix.latitudeL()) + "&long=" + String(fix.longitudeL());
                    //IP Address of Web Server
                    http.begin("http://192.168.0.10:8000/api/v0/location/");
                    http.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
                    int httpCode = http.POST(postData);   //Send the request
                    String payload = http.getString();    //Get the response payload  
                    DEBUG_PORT.println("code:");
                    DEBUG_PORT.println(httpCode);   //Print HTTP return code
                    DEBUG_PORT.println("data:");    //Print request response payload
                    DEBUG_PORT.println(payload);    //Print request response payload
                    http.end();  //Close connection
                  }
                  //Sleep for 60 seconds
                  ESP.deepSleep(60e6);
                }

__api.php - /routes/api.php__

Defines the route for the location API endpoint

                Route::group(['prefix' => 'v0'], function(){    
                    Route::post('/location', 'API\v0\ApiController@post_location'); 
                });

__ApiController.php - App/Http/Controllers/Api/V0__

Parses in the request object from the GPS receiver, creates the location object and fires the ```NewLocation``` event before returning a 200 OK Response.

                class ApiController extends Controller
                {
                    function post_location(Request $request) {
                        $location = new Location;
                        $location->lat =  $request->input('lat') / 10000000;
                        $location->long = $request->input('long') / 10000000;
                        $location->save();
                        event(new NewLocation($location));
                        return response()->json(['status'=>200]);
                    }
                }

__NewLocation.php - /App/Events/NewLocation.php__
Responsible for sending the location object to pusher, wrapping the location object in a ```new-location``` message and broadcasting it on the ```location``` channel

                class NewLocation implements ShouldBroadcast
                {
                    use Dispatchable, InteractsWithSockets, SerializesModels;

                    public $location; 

                    /**
                     * Create a new event instance.
                     *
                     * @return void
                     */

                    public function __construct(Location $location)
                    {
                        $this->location = $location;
                    }

                    /**
                     * Get the channels the event should broadcast on.
                     *
                     * @return \Illuminate\Broadcasting\Channel|array
                     */
                    public function broadcastOn()
                    {
                        return new Channel('location');
                    }

                    public function broadcastAs()
                    {
                        return 'new-location';
                    }
                }

__MapComponent.vue - /resources/js/components/MapComponent.vue__

Responsible for drawing the map and updating the location of the GPS receiver, the listener function listens for ```new-location``` messages on the ```location``` channel 

                var channel = Echo.channel('location');
                $(document).ready(function () {
                    var mymap = L.map('mapid').setView([53.557699, -2.869379], 16);
                    L.tileLayer('https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/{id}/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token={accessToken}', {

                        id: 'mapbox/streets-v11',
                        tileSize: 512,
                        zoomOffset: -1,
                        accessToken: '[REDACTED]'
                    }).addTo(mymap);
                    var marker = L.marker([51.508, -3.0]).addTo(mymap);
                    channel.listen('.new-location', function (data) {
                        var latlng = L.latLng(data.location.lat, data.location.long);
                        marker.setLatLng(latlng);
                    });
                });
